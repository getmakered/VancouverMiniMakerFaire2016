# 2016 Vancouver Mini Maker Faire 2016

Wow, what an exciting event!  Thank you for taking the time to get scanned at the GetMakered 3D Selfie Trailer at the 2016 Vancouver Mini Maker Faire!  Now that we have recovered, we have been busy getting all the scans that we did put online.  You can either download your scan then _print it yourself_ at your nearest MakerSpace/HackSpace or School that has a 3D printer.  **Or** _let us print it for you_!

The Scans we did of you can be found here:

## Let Us Print it for you!

If you'd like to get a printed version of your image, Owyn, one of the GetMakered Crew will happily print you for you for a small fee.  The Scans are numbered and you should have received your number in an email with your number. We do this to preserve the privacy of individuals. To purchase your print please click here:

By purchasing a print you will be helping support our ongoing efforts to bring more 3D Adventures to the Sunshine Coast, BC!  Thank you!

## Print It Yourself!

###(1) Download Your Scan!

The Scans are numbered and you should have received an email with your number. We do this to preserve the privacy of individuals.

###(2) Cleaning Up Your Scanned Image.

Most of your files are near perfect and will not have any issues, but if you see extra floaty bits in your scan or a hole in your head, you might want to clean the image up a bit.

We usually try and delete any floating items or bizarre shapes that might have accidentally been added to your image. It's quite easy to remove and it should be cleaned up prior to printing.

Some tools that can be used for cleanup are:

1. [MS 3D Builder - Comes with Windows 10 and 8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/apps/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6)
2. [Autodesk MeshMixer](http://www.meshmixer.com)
3. [Autodesk TinkerCAD](http://www.tinkercad.com)

###(3) Get Printing!

Each 3D printer has slightly different way of printing the file so read your printer's manual before you start printing to be sure you've selected the right parameters for your particular. We highly recommend the **Tinkerine Ditto Pro** which you saw us printing with at the event. They are Vancouver-based and have great technical support too: http://www.tinkerine.com

Many thanks for taking the time to get scanned and learn about 3D technology with GetMakered! If you could share a picture of your results with us on our Facebook page, we'd love to see!
